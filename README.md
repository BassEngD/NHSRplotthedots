This package is built by the NHS-R community to provide tools for
drawing statistical process control (SPC) charts. This package supports
the NHSE/I programme ‘Making Data Count’, and allows users to draw XmR
charts, use change points, and apply rules with summary indicators for
when rules are breached.

This package is in the very early stages of development and is not
stable for use at this point.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nhs-r-community/NHSRplotthedots")

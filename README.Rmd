This package is built by the NHS-R community to provide tools for drawing statistical process control (SPC) charts. This package supports the NHSE/I programme 'Making Data Count', and allows users to draw XmR charts, use change points, and apply rules with summary indicators for when rules are breached.

This package is in the very early stages of development and is not stable for use at this point.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nhs-r-community/NHSRplotthedots")
```

## Release summary
This is first release for the NHS-R Community's 'Plot the Dots' package.  This supports NHS England and NHS Improvement's 'Making Data Count' campaign which encourages the use of run charts and statistical process control charts for more informed decision making.  This package creates methods for XmR charts, with consideration for multiple indicators with facets, 'rebasing', and applying rules sets with summary indicators.  This package is for use across the NHS, augmenting existing tools in SQL and MS Excel.
